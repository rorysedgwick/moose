## HTML & CSS Interview Challenge


This repository aims to mimic a typical HTML and CSS interview challenge for a Junior Front-end Developer role. It will include similar questions to those found in an actual challenge and will be a way to gauge your fluency with these skills. The aim of the test is see how well you can identify and fix errors in someone else's code, both in HTML and CSS. A large part of the test is to see how you respond to completely unfamiliar code and ------------ . Give yourself 45 minutes to complete the challenge.

 If you are feeling adventurous and want to make the challenge more realistic, try completing it in a text editor you have never used before. Each interview sitation may require you use a novel editor and learning to navigate slightly unfamiliar interfaces will help you make the most of your time during these tests. Why not try:

 - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.9.2.html)  
 - [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/uex.html)  
 - [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/download.html)  
 - [ElitePad Lite](http://www.editpadlite.com/download.html) (Windows only)  
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/) (if you've never used it before)  
 - [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (if you've never used it before)  

### Setup
- ```git clone``` this repository onto your local machine and ```cd moose```  
- There will be two folders: /access & /noaccess. Do not edit anything in the /noaccess folder  
- Within /access there will be an HTML file and an empty CSS file. This is where you will make your changes  
- There will also be a questions sheet. This will indicate the fixes/improvement you are required to make to the index.html file  
- Open ```index.html``` in your favourite browser and begin the test  


The company that set the challenge that inspired this example will remain anonymous, and the test has been sufficiently modified to not exactly mirror the questions asked.
