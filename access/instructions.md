### Instructions

*Be aware:* most of the links on the page do not lead anywhere. This is intentional and fixing them is not part of this challenge. There are also a number of 404 errors visible in the browser console: these can be ignored as they are also not part of the actual test.
  
These are the individual changes you are required to indentify and correct within the web page.

1. **Set the banner image to display this image as the background**

7. **Now look through the page and try to spot any additional errors. Note these down, along with how you would go about correcting them.** These will all be visual/stylistic errors or inconsistencies and not related to any functionality.
