### Instructions

*Beware:* there are many links on the page which do not lead anywhere. This is intentional and fixing them is not part of the current challenge.

These are the individual changes you are required to indentify and correct within the web page.


1. An image has an incorrect <alt> tag. Find it and correct it.  
That section of the page should look like this:  
[insert screenshot]  

2. This text is overflowing its container div. Resize the container to make sure all the text is visible

3. Turn this text into a link

4. Move this image 10px to the left  
[image]

5. Change the text content of this div so that is says "---- --- ----" and the text is all on the same line  


~~6. Now look through the site and try to spot any extra errors. Note these down, along with how you would go about correcting them.  ~~
